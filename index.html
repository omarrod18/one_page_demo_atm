            <h3>The Club's History</h3>
            <p>Club Atletico Morelia was founded in 1950 in Mexico's newly created "Segunda Division de Futbol Mexicano". <br>
            The Club's first promotion to Mexico's first division came in 1957, where the "Canaries" remained for 11 years, until they unfortunately relegated back into the second division.</p>
            <p>After suffering relegation, the Club was disbanded and re-appeared in 1971. Morelia fought hard for promotion for 10 years, and eventually won promotion back into the first division in 1981.
                In 1989, Morelia found it's forever home in the famous "Estadio Morelos", a stadium with a fan capacity of around 40,000.
            </p>
            <p>In December of the year 2000, Morelia achieved the greatest honour there was; they won the league title against Club Toluca. It would take another 14 years for the club to see silverware again,
                when they defeated Atlas in a penalty shoot-out to win the Copa MX.
            </p>
            <p>In 2020, shortly after the world shut down due to the Coronavirus-19 pandemic, it was announced that the franchise was moving out of Morelia. The city did not last long without their beloved team, though.
                After the move, the government of the state of Michoacan, along with various entrepreneurs, revived the club, bringing professional football back to the city of Morelia.
            </p>
            <p>Atletico Morelia now play in Mexico's second division, dubbed the "Liga de Expansion". They have won one league title, and have played in the final two additional times. 
                The club patiently awaits the Mexican Football Federation (FMF) to re-allow promotion and relegation into their football league structure, so the club can return to where it belongs, amongst the best teams in Mexico.
            </p>
